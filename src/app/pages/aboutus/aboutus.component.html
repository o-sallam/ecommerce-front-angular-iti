          <h2>A Legacy of Victorian Excellence</h2>
          <p>Founded in 1985 by antique enthusiast Margaret Thornfield, Victorian Elegance began as a small
             collection of carefully curated pieces discovered in English country estates. What started as a
             passion for preserving history has grown into one of the UK's most trusted sources for authentic
             Victorian furniture.</p>

          <p>Our journey spans over three decades of dedicated sourcing, restoration, and curation. We travel
             across Britain and Europe, building relationships with estate agents, private collectors, and
             auction houses to find the finest examples of Victorian craftsmanship.</p>

          <p>Every piece in our collection tells a storyâ€”from grand dining tables that once hosted elaborate
             dinner parties to intimate writing desks where love letters were penned. We believe that furniture
             should not merely fill a space, but enrich lives with beauty, history, and meaning.</p>
